          When I was 16, I thought I found the perfect volunteering experience – saving sea turtles in Costa Rica! The program seemed to have everything I wanted, including unique jungle housing, time spent closely examining and saving sea turtles, exciting surf excursions, and a guaranteed team coordinator who would help me navigate a foreign land and new experiences. But my experience was nothing like what I had imagined. On top of an uninterested coordinator and crowded, bug-filled housing, I only got to spend 10 minutes (in 20 days!) monitoring the sea turtles. I returned home, disappointed, but not disheartened.

          Hoping to redeem Costa Rica, I left for a similar excursion to Ecuador. This trip promised time cultivating indigenous plant species and encouraging natural bird behavior to maintain the biodiversity of the Galapagos Islands. <br><br>Despite having done extensive research this time, I was, again, disappointed. No cell service, no coordinator within reach and, instead of maintaining the fragile ecosystem, I spent most days peeling coffee beans in the kitchen.

          Returning home, I was frustrated by the misrepresentation of both trips. My passion for volunteering remained, but how could I go on another trip like these two? If only I had known more beforehand, I could have chosen better, and been better prepared when I arrived. If only I was in contact with people who had gone before me instead of feeling like I’m alone on my own path, these trips could have been the excursions of a lifetime! I couldn’t let anyone else make the same mistakes I did. So, I turned the “if only’s” into one simple word: Explorate."

            It was inspired by my <span class="bold"> personal international volunteering experience </span> and
            how I found that my expectation and reality didn’t really line up. I wanted
            to create <span class="bold"> a platform where volunteers could be more prepared and inspired for
            their trip by reading other’s stories. </span> To proceed, I conducted a <span class="bold"> semi-structured </span>
            interview with 15 other volunteers. Then, I interviewed NGO in developing countries
            about their needs to gain an understanding of the covid context to aid future planning.
            From here, I  <span class="bold"> synthesized the interviews </span> to craft my <span class="bold">mission and value statements.</span>

            <p>I provided 3 options for users to choose from to best design the display of the review, which is one of the main sections of my website.
              Many favored the last option because they liked having the options to see comments
              about specific parts of the experience (ex. accomodation) in a more organized format with the drop-down button.

            <p>I showed users in this demo how they would be able to connect with
              one another and asked whether they would be interested in using this feature.
              All of them gave positive feedback! Therefore, aside from making it
              a one-way interaction of reviews, I aim to build two-way connections
              within the international volunteering community and make the experience less dauting.
